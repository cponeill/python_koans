# Triangle Project Code.

# Triangle analyzes the lengths of the sides of a triangle
# (represented by a, b and c) and returns the type of triangle.
#
# It returns:
#   'equilateral'  if all sides are equal
#   'isosceles'    if exactly 2 sides are equal
#   'scalene'      if no sides are equal
#
# The tests for this method can be found in
#   about_triangle_project.py
# and
